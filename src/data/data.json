	   "description":"A premium, full-metal G-SHOCK MR-G timepiece for the sea — the titanium armor-clad, airtight MRGBF1000 with ISO 200-meter water resistance joins the FROGMAN family of full-fledged diver's watches.\nThis MR-G diver's watch takes the unique asymmetrical design, screw-lock case back and distinctive diving frog character — which were so popular when FROGMAN came out back in 1993 — to a whole new level.\nOriginally produced in resin, the complex design has now been remade in titanium, with each component crafted separately and polished meticulously for an entirely new feel of high-end quality. The watch is built with an intricate combination of over 70 exterior components, including an O-ring waterproof seal to deliver outstanding FROGMAN water resistance and special buffers to strengthen the shock-resistant structure — all while maintaining the beauty of form the MR-G line is known for.\nFor enhanced strength, we've developed a protective structure with fluoro rubber buffers installed between the multiple bezel parts. This structure features face-guarding functionality that helps to absorb shocks from the front and the sides, as well as protecting the crystal.\nThe dedicated MR-G module features a gold-plated retainer plate. The screw-lock case back is fit with sapphire crystal finished in vibrant blue vapor deposition and engraved with the iconic FROGMAN diving frog character.\nDura Soft, a durable and comfortable fluoro rubber, is used for the band, and Ti64 titanium alloy for the buckle and band loop. Simply remove the side pins while pressing the buttons on the lugs' undersides to quickly and easily swap out the band.\nMore than just handsome, this timepiece provides superior functionality, as well. Equipped with Bluetooth®, the hour and minute hands overlap and work in unison to form a single hand when in diving mode, making the time spent underwater (minutes) easy and intuitive to see and delivering high visibility. Download the dedicated app to pair with your smartphone and easily display tide data for more than 3,000 locations around the world. Check dive logs on your smartphone and get more details on data tracked by your watch.",

High-density mounting keeps the analog-digital combination module slim, while still providing the advanced functions you love in a compact profile and comfortable fit.\n\nWe take it way back with the octagonal bezel and dimpled band design of the original from 1983, all done in metal. The bezel and band are coated with yellow gold ion plating. The stainless steel bezel — formed three-dimensionally through a time-consuming forging, cutting, and polishing process — is finished beautifully with a circular hairline treatment on the top surface and mirror polish on the slopes.\n\nPairs with a smartphone via Bluetooth®. Simply tap into the dedicated app for precision timekeeping that keeps you on track. With Tough Solar, a high-brightness LED light and a range of other convenient functions, this is a timepiece that delivers on style and practical utility.",

An LCD screen at the face's center displays the time clearly, while also providing space for several additional and useful functions, including the date, a stopwatch, and alarm. All settings are controlled by three convenient buttons on the case sides. \n  This collaboration showcases both brand's commitment to timeless, functional design. \n\n\nAbout rag & bone】\nSince its origins in New York in 2002, rag & bone has established itself as a critical and commercial success in the international fashion world.

Its modern design is both appealing and functional, with a beautiful and sturdy matching wooden stand and three fixed pedals.\n\nA digital grand piano is a perfect solution when an acoustic grand is impractical, especially one that delivers the sound and feel of a concert grand in a fraction of the space. With its elegant white finish, the PX-S7000WE is as much of a joy to see as it is to play. It also delivers the sound of three of the world's most legendary pianos (Hamburg, New York, and Berlin) as part of its collection of 400 Tones.\n\nAs with any digital piano, an authentic feel is as important as sound quality. The Smart Hybrid Hammer Action keys take the PX-S7000WE's realism to a new level, featuring Spruce key construction, advanced counterweights, and new dampening materials. These keys are dynamic, whisper-quiet and satisfying to play.\n\nDesigned to be beautiful from every angle, the PX-S7000WE adds elegance, harmony, and modern style to any space. Unlike nearly any other digital piano, it can serve as a musical centerpiece rather than simply being placed near a wall. It can also be removed from its stand and played anywhere. Add 8 AA batteries, the optional SC-900 carrying bag, and the optional SP-34 three-pedal unit, and your PX-S7000 is ready to perform wherever your music takes you.",
